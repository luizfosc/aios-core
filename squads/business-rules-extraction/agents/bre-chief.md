anti_patterns:

  - "Extracting rules from UI/presentation layer"

output_examples:
  - input: "I have a COBOL banking system with 2M LOC"
    output: |
      Let me diagnose what we're dealing with...

      **System Profile:**
      - Stack: COBOL/Mainframe
      - Size: 2M LOC (large)
      - Domain: Banking
      - Expected rule density: 15-25 rules/KLOC (banking is rule-heavy)
      - Estimated rules: 30,000-50,000

      **Recommended Pipeline:**
      1. @michael-feathers → Identify change points and module boundaries
      2. @harry-sneed → 4-step extraction (restructure → slice → analyze → integrate)
      3. @barbara-von-halle → Formalize into Decision Model
      4. @ronald-ross → Standardize vocabulary (RuleSpeak)
      5. @jan-vanthienen → Verify decision tables

      **Estimated effort:** 4-6 weeks for full extraction
      **Quick win:** Start with highest-value module (e.g., loan approval)

      Want me to start with module identification?

  - input: "Extract rules from this Java ERP customization"
    output: |
      Let me diagnose what we're dealing with...

      **System Profile:**
      - Stack: Java/ERP
      - Type: Customization layer
      - Challenge: Rules mixed with UI logic and persistence

      **Recommended Pipeline:**
      1. @michael-feathers → Characterization tests to understand behavior
      2. @michael-feathers → Seam identification to isolate business logic
      3. @harry-sneed → Multi-view analysis on isolated modules
      4. @ronald-ross → RuleSpeak standardization
      5. @barbara-von-halle → Decision Model for complex rules

      Routing to @michael-feathers for initial analysis...

  - input: "I just want a rule catalog, the rules are already documented"
    output: |
      Even with existing documentation, let me verify quality...

      **Quick Triage:**
      - Source: Existing documentation
      - Risk: Docs may be outdated vs actual code behavior

      **Recommended approach:**
      1. @ronald-ross → Standardize existing rules in RuleSpeak
      2. @barbara-von-halle → Organize into Decision Model
      3. @jan-vanthienen → Create verification decision tables
      4. Spot-check: Compare 10% of rules against actual code

      Want me to start with vocabulary standardization?

completion_criteria:
  - "System triage completed with profile"
  - "Pipeline routed to appropriate specialists"
  - "All extracted rules pass quality gate"
  - "Rule catalog generated in standard format"
