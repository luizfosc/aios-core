# Validation Handoff - File Research Squad

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Created by:** aios-master (Orion)
**Status:** ⚠️ Pending validation
**Validation sequence:** @architect → @squad-creator → @qa

---

## Context

Created a NEW squad called **file-research** based on the **tech-search** skill architecture.

**User Request:** "Create a squad like tech-search, but for finding diverse files on the internet (PDFs, EPUBs, etc.)"

**Approach:** Faithful copy of tech-search structure, adapted for file discovery instead of tech research.

### Key Adaptations from tech-search

| Aspect | tech-search | file-research |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Focus** | Technical documentation | Files (PDFs, EPUBs, DOCs, etc.) |
| **Query decomposition** | Technical sub-queries | File-focused with operators |
| **Search strategy** | WebSearch + Exa | Apify (scraping) → Exa → WebSearch |
| **Deep read** | WebFetch full content | WebFetch metadata only |
| **Output** | Code examples, findings | Download links, file metadata |
| **Security** | No production code | No auto-download |

## Additional Context

### Design Decisions

**Why 6 phases?**
- Copied from tech-search proven architecture
- Each phase has distinct responsibility
- Allows for parallel workers in Phase 3

**Why max 2 waves?**
- Balance between coverage and cost
- Tech-search uses 2 waves successfully
- Prevents infinite loops

**Why Apify first in tool hierarchy?**
- Apify has specialized file scrapers
- Better for file discovery than general search
- Fallback to Exa/WebSearch ensures robustness

**Why no auto-download?**
- Security risk (malware, large files)
- User should review before downloading
- Provides links only, user controls download

**Why Haiku workers?**
- Cost-efficient for parallel search
- Simple search+extract tasks
- Main model for synthesis (complex reasoning)

### Known Limitations

**Intentional:**
- No file content parsing (only metadata)
- No file conversion (out of scope)
- No auto-download (security)
- Max 2 waves (cost control)

**Technical:**
- Depends on MCP availability (has fallbacks)
- Credibility assessment is heuristic (domain-based)
- Metadata extraction depends on source quality

### Future Enhancements (Post-Validation)

- Integration with file storage services (KnowledgeBase, Google Drive)
- Advanced credibility scoring (ML-based)
- File content preview (safe sandbox)
- Batch file validation
- Citation extraction for academic papers
